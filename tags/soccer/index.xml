      <description>Manchester United has not won the English Premier League title ever since Sir Alex Ferguson, retired from his role as manager after the 2012/13 season. To this day, his successors David Moyes, Louis Van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have not been able to get success back to Old Trafford. David Moyes was chosen as the replacement right after Sir Alex retired, however, Moyes did not last long as manager, following Moyes, Louis Van Gaal was at the club from 2014 to 2016, where he managed to win just one cup competition which was the FA Cup.</description>
